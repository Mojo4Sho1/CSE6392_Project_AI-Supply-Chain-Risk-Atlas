# Specs Index

Purpose: route agents to only the specification documents needed for the current task.

## How to Use
1. Read `docs/handoff/NEXT_TASK.md`.
2. Match task scope to entries below.
3. Open only relevant spec files/sections.
4. Add new specs here immediately when created.

## Entry Format
- `path`: spec file path
- `summary`: what the document defines
- `tags`: routing keywords
- `read-when`: explicit trigger for loading this spec

## Specs
_No spec files registered yet._

When adding the first spec, use this template:

- `path`: `docs/specs/<filename>.md`
- `summary`: <one to two sentence authoritative scope>
- `tags`: `<tag1>`, `<tag2>`, `<tag3>`
- `read-when`: <specific condition>
