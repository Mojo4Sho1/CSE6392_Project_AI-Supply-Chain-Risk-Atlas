# NEXT_TASK

Last updated: 2026-02-23

## Priority Tasks
1. Finalize handoff template style using reference examples from prior project.
2. Define first set of spec documents and create them in `docs/specs/`.
3. Register each new spec in `docs/specs/_INDEX.md` with tags and read triggers.
4. Update `AGENTS.md` with finalized conda environment details.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Handoff files reflect agreed template format and required sections.
- At least one authoritative spec exists and is indexed.
- `_INDEX.md` enables selective spec routing without full-spec ingestion.
- Agent read order remains: AGENTS -> CURRENT_STATUS -> NEXT_TASK -> _INDEX -> relevant specs only.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Keep file names human-readable for spec docs.
- Prefer direct file-path references in tasks.
- Avoid adding broad process rules until templates are finalized.
