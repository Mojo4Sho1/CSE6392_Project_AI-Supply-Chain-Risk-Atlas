## Project Phase
Planning and repository scaffolding.

## Completed
- Established initial agent-oriented documentation structure.
- Added root-level `AGENTS.md` with required read order and handoff policy.
- Added `docs/specs/_INDEX.md` for selective spec routing.
- Added handoff files under `docs/handoff/`.

## In Progress
- Defining first authoritative spec documents.
- Aligning handoff templates to preferred style from prior projects.

## Known Gaps
- Conda environment name not finalized in `AGENTS.md`.
- No registered spec documents yet.
- `NEXT_TASK.md` currently contains bootstrap tasks only.

## Validation
- Directory scaffold created: `docs/specs`, `docs/handoff`.
- Required control files are present.
